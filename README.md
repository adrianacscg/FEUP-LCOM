# Project Title: Christmas Tamagotchi

Project Description:
In our project we are going to build a Tamagotchi with a Christmas theme all throughout, by creating a similar looking virtual device that you can interact with in a similar way you would with a real physical Tamagotchi. You’ll be able to pick your virtual pet, name it, feed it, make it sleep and play a mini game with it. There will also be 2 bars with the level of hunger and sleep of your pet. You’ll also be able to check the real time on the Tamagotchi’s screen.

Devices to be used:

•	Timer/Counter
Role: Count the time the pet has to jump on the platforms in the mini game i.e. the time until it reaches zero.
Count the time passing to decrease the sleep and hunger bars.
Functionality: Timer interrupt

•	Keyboard
Role: Insert the name of our pet.
Allow your pet to jump left or right during the mini game.

Functionality: Read and interpret the scancodes, both make codes and break codes, generated by the PC's keyboard via interrupts.

•	Mouse
Role: Click on a character to choose it. 
Click on the Tamagotchi’s buttons to play the mini game and to make your pet sleep. 
Drag and drop the food on the screen onto your pet to feed it.
Functionality: Both the mouse’s left button and the mouse’s movement.

•	Video Card
Role: All the graphics of the Tamagotchi will be done using the video card.
Functionality: The video card graphics mode.

•	RTC
Role: Display the real time on the Tamagotchi’s screen. 
Functionality: Real time clock.
